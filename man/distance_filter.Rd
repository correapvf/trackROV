\title{Distance threshold filter}
\usage{
distance_filter(x, d = 5, select = NULL)

distance_filter_mean(x, d = 5, select = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{'track' object.}

\item{d}{Distance threshold, same units original data.}

\item{select}{character. The filter is applied only in these dives.}
}
\description{
Only keep points after a distance \code{d} has been reached.
Check \href{https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/tutorials/track_filters.html}{here} for a more detailed
explanation of how the filter works.
}
\details{
\code{distance_filter_mean} is similar, but it adds an extra step where the mean point is calculated
for each group based on the distance threshold. This can minimize the effect of outliers.
